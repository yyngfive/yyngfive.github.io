                Apple's logo is one of the most familiar icons around the world.
                But what's the story about the Apple logo?
                The image of the apple is obvious,because that's the name of the company.

                The famous story is that the logo shows respect and honour for Alan Turing.
                He was the father of computer science.
                He researched AI(artificial intelligence) and unlocked German wartime codes.
                However,after the war,he was put into prison,because of his beliefs.
                He could not stand the looking down and chose to bite a poisoned apple to end his life in the prison.

                However ,Rob Janoff,who designed the famous Apple logo,said,"It is not the truth,but only a legend.
                The real reason why I designed it with a bite is very simple .
                I wanted people to get that it was an apple not a cherry.
                When I go to markets to buy apples,I always mistake apples for cherries.
                It really has nothing to do whit the scientist."

                Are you kidding?
                An apple is much bigger than a cherry.It is very easy to tell.
                But if you use an aple to design a logo,some people may mistake it for a cherry.
